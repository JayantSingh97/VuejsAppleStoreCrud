Project Api configuration information.

This Project has dependency on https://github.com/JayantSingh97/MicrosoftUnityDependencyInjectionApi So Please download Api From 
https://github.com/JayantSingh97/MicrosoftUnityDependencyInjectionApi and just need to run the api in 
Microsoft visual studio latest version.

This project is already configured with https://github.com/JayantSingh97/MicrosoftUnityDependencyInjectionApi APi.

Vue.js Project Configuartion information.

1- If you are facing any compilation issue then simply run the following command in your command prompt under your Vueapp directory.

npm i

After executing the 'npm i' simply build the application and retry.

Because for performance resion Github ignores the node_modules folder because it contains large amount of storage.

npm i command creates new node_modules and restores all the project dependency.


Thank you.
